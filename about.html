                <h2>About Indie Games</h2>
                <p>Indie games are created by small teams or individual developers without large publisher backing. These games allow for creative freedom, often offering unique gameplay and storytelling experiences. Platforms like Steam and itch.io have made it easier for indie developers to share their work, leading to the rise of highly successful titles such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Celeste</em>, and <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>
                
                <p>What sets indie games apart is their ability to experiment with bold ideas and explore themes that mainstream games may not. They push the boundaries of what games can be and often bring fresh perspectives to the industry. Supporting indie developers helps foster innovation and ensures these unique games continue to thrive.</p>
